  In order to run the test suite you need to setup a Fortnox developer account and
  get yourself some credentials for a client and a sandbox account (or real fortnox account).

  The tests are here for convenience only if further development or testing is to be done
  on the FortnoxEx module.

  The tests are not expected to be running in continuous integration.
